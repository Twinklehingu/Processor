# Processor

 This is a Flask web application for image manipulation. The application allows users to upload an image, apply various image transformation operations,  and then save the transformed image. The application has two pages, "index.html" and "process.html". The "index.html" page is the default access page that has a file picker for selecting an image to upload. When an image is selected, the page forwards the user to the "process.html" page to apply various image transformation operations. The "process.html" page contains a form that allows users to select various image transformation operations such as  rotation, flip, resize, thumbnail, grayscale, and rotate leftright. After selecting the  desired image transformation operations, the user submits the form, and the transformed image is saved. The application uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to apply the image transformation operations. 
#The application also uses the Flask framework for web development.
